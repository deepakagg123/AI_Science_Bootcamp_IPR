# AI_Science_Bootcamp_IPR

This directory contains the following files:
1. Consolidated - Climate, CFD: Slides used during the bootcamp during day-1 and day-2.
2. AI_connection_port_forwarding: Steps used for launching the jupyter run in the cluster and accessing the notebook from the local machine.
3. script_jupyter_run: Script used for launching the jupyter run as a batch job. (Minor modifications in the script will be required during the launch)

The singularity images used for the hands-on sessions are available in the cluster at the location /home/application/singularity_images/singularity_3.4.1/.

The labs required for the hands-on lab sessions are also available at their source location https://github.com/gpuhackathons-org/gpubootcamp/tree/master/hpc_ai but images need to be created from the singularity definition files.
